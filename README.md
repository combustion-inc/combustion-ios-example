# Combustion iOS BLE Example
## Overview
An example project illustrating how to use the [Combustion iOS BLE](https://github.com/combustion-inc/combustion-ios-ble) framework to communicate with Combustion Inc. probes.

This simple example illustrates showing a list of all discovered probes, viewing detailed information about an individual probe, and connecting to and retrieving logged temperatures from that probe. It also illustrates CSV export of that retrieved logged data.
