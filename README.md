# Combustion iOS BLE Example iOS App
## Overview
An example project illustrating how to use the [Combustion iOS BLE](https://github.com/combustion-inc/combustion-ios-ble) framework to communicate with Combustion Inc. Predictive Thermometers.

This simple example illustrates showing a list of all discovered thermometers, viewing detailed information about an individual thermometer, and connecting to and retrieving logged temperatures from that thermometer. It also illustrates CSV export of that retrieved logged data.

## About Combustion Inc.

We build nice things that make cooking more enjoyable. Like a thermometer that's wireless, oven-safe, and uses machine learning to do what no other thermometer can: predict your food’s cooking and resting times with uncanny accuracy. 

Our Predictive Thermometer's eight temperature sensors measure the temp outside and inside the food, in the center and at the surface, and nearly everywhere in between. So you know what’s really happening in and around your food. There's a display Timer that's big and bold—legible even through tears of joy and chopped onions—and a mobile app. 

Or you can create your own mobile app to work with the Predictive Thermometer using our open source BLE communication framework. This example app should help you get started.
